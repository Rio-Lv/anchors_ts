<h1>Anchors</h1>

<h3>
Anchors is a polygon editing tool I created to build rock like faces of anyshape.
</h3>

<p>It uses a custom light engine that changes based of the elevation of each node.</p>

<p>Anchors is made as a NEXT.js app. Anchors live updates the JSON which can easily be copied on to clipboard. Currently there no re-injection of JSON in the program but it might be added later on.</p>
